## Description

This assignment was another slog. I think you'll find evidence of that in the lack of style I applied to my app. It's rather ugly but, hey, it functions great! 

This is one I'll have to return to and reshape using Sequelize. 

## User Story
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
- Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
- Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
